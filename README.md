# simulplay

This project barely works so far, I have to clean it up so it's actually usable.

Syncs playback between video players on separate devices.

Right now, it only supports VLC.

Only tested on OS X (almost definitely does not work on Windows)

To run the server:
node server/server

To run the client:
Change the constants at the top of controller/controller.js so they are configured correctly.

node controller/Controller
